							<p>Video game graphics started off extremely basic with limited colour pallets and small sizes due to the hardware limitations of the time. Games appeared blocky and used only basic colours as anything to complex may waste space on the discs on memory cards they were stored on. Games now can be as complex as they want or need to be as in most cases they are not even limited by the storage devices as most consoles and PC have over a TB of storage space. 
							<p>Graphics now play a major role in a games success as if it does not have good graphics or look visually pleasing then there isn’t really much point in playing the game. Older games didn’t have to worry about this as the only thing people cared about was the gameplay, which is now secondary to the graphics and story of the game.
