						<p>One of the most common and well-known videogame genres is the first person shooter in which the player takes control of a character in the game and plays through their perspective, the character may be crucial to the plot and is the centre of the story or they may just be a vessel for the player to experience the game through who has no real stakes in the games story. Most FPS games tend to have two modes the single player mode in which the player will play alone fighting against AI and the multiplayer mode in which the player will play against and with a group of other players from around the world where they will work together to beat the enemy team of players and win the game.
						<p>An MMO is a game most commonly set in a fantasy setting in which you create a character as a specific race and then select the class that they will be. You will level that character from zero to whatever the max level in the game is for example in World of Warcraft the current max level is 110. Hundreds of other players will be playing on the same server as you at the same time, but they will be playing it their way while you play your way. 
						<p>In a MOBA two teams battle it out to reach an objective this most commonly the core of the enemy's base. This will involve the teams pushing 3 lanes with AI called ads which soak up damage of the towers that defend each lane while the towers target the ads the players must destroy them.
						<p>A rhythm game will have the player clicking buttons to a song. One of the most played rhythm games is called OSU!. In OSU! you click circles to the beat of a song there is many different difficulties to each song some are very slow, and some are very fast.
						<p>Most developers tend to create games designed around the multiplayer aspects or that incorporate leader board features as to give the player a goal when playing and have the player hooked on a game from longer than the few hours it takes to complete most single player experiences. If the player has on overall goal to beat a score on reach a high level, they are more likely to spend much more time on the game and may even purchase microtransaction within the game. Most genres now are a combination of multiple genres mashed into one such as the MOBA (Multiplayer Online Battle Arena) which combines top down gameplay with online battle aspects.
