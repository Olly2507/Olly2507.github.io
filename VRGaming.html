							<p>The above video’s I created to showcase two VR game which I enjoy playing H3VR and Beat Saber the left video is the normal version of Beat Saber and the middle I have used a mod to make the two saber’s join together and act as one.
							<p>Modern VR gaming began with the Kickstarter for the Oculus Rift in 2012 its first of two dev kits which where experimental build was released to backers in mid-2013 the dev kit 2 was sent to backers in mid-2014. By this point some small developers had backed the Oculus and began working a small experimental games which where basic and only used the headsets as a camera for the player, who would wear the headset to look around the game but would have to move using the keyboard or a console controller. The rift finally released its first consumer version in early 2016. The new consumer version included two handheld controllers and infrared cameras which are used for positional tracking allowing players to move around the room in boundary’s they’d set for themselves. 
							<p>The HTC Vive was a direct competitor to the Oculus and was first announced in 2014 during a demonstration of the technology. Unlike the Oculus is development was kept mostly under wraps and only game and software developers received early copy’s before release so that games could be created for the release of the device. It released June 7th 2016 just three months after the Oculus. The Vive boasted much better tracking than the Oculus and only required two infra-red trackers to have operate its 3D room scale tracking unlike the Oculus required 3 trackers. 
							<p>After the release of these two devices VR games made massive strides from only been able to be played while seated to player using purpose built controllers to navigate the game’s and been able to move about in their physical space to make more precise movements such as hiding behind and peaking around a corner. Some VR games now even have Competitive scene’s in which player go up against each other in tournaments all around the world.
