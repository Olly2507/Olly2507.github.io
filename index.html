							 	<p>Welcome to my website which will take you on a journey through the improvements and advancements made in gaming. From simple 8-bit games to advanced VR gaming.	
								<p>The genres page will cover some simple gaming genres and how most games now are not tied down to a single genre but instead pull inspiration from many different genres.
								<p>The how graphics have improved over time page will compare old 8-bit games against modern games and talk about how the graphics have improved and changed over time.
								<p>Visual styles will cover some basic and unique styles which modern games use from photorealism to Cel-shading.
								<p>VR gaming has some videos showing off the current state of VR gaming which I have made myself and will also talk about how VR gaming has made massive strides in development over such a short time.
